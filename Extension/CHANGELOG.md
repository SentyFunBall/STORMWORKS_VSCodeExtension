# Change Log
### [0.0.6] - 12th December 2021
**major**
- Fixed number parsing issue affecting everybody outside of English-language countries! (sorry!)
- Fixed _debug_simulator_log.txt not generating if the folder has spaces in it's path

**minor**
- Resolved two warnings generated in the _build.lua and _simulator.lua files that were annoying to people who like clean code.

### [0.0.5] - 11th December 2021
**major**
- Added error log file for the simulator, so we can solve more issues
- Now creates a .code-workspace file by default in the first project you make. Which simplifies life for new VSCode users.
- Added "Open Found Workspaces" for when users accidentally open a folder, instead of a workspace; again, to simplify life for new VSCode users.
- Improved pre and post build steps in lua.
- Fixed issue where running files that are in sub-folders wouldn't work, due to an incorrectly generated require path.
- Replaced internal renderer for more accurate results

**other**
- Removed onLBSimulatorInit method, to account for MCs where properties are read in global space, before the first tick
- Set cpath and path of the debugger when running, to reduce the chance of an occasional issue when using multiple workspaces
- Simulator now displays 32-bit floats, rather than 64-bit doubles
- Fixed simulator config "portrait mode" previously not working
- Fixed touch coordinates going outside normal range
- Fixed simulator zoom issue
